# What is a DH Manifesto?  
  
For this project, I will be writing an epic poetic plea linking the data I have created as a "digital humanist". Utilizing the tools and interfaces I have found most useful in my line of work as well as the numerous written sources on "DH" I've gathered during my graduate degree, I will create a resource bank of information that I will then use as links in the poem and as materials for distributing to the "DH" community.
